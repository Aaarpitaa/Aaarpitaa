ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Aaarpitaa

Iâ€™m a Biostatistician and Data Scientist with experience supporting NIH-funded clinical trials, real-world evidence studies, and population health research

I specialize in study design, grant writing, advanced statistical modeling, and reproducible programming in R and SAS

My work spans from oncology and cardiology to projects on social determinants of health, with a strong focus on translating data into actionable insights

I began my career as a dentist and bring that clinical perspective into my research, bridging the gap between clinical practice and data science

Iâ€™m passionate about improving healthcare outcomes and collaborating across disciplines to make data meaningful for policy, practice, and patients

## My Work Experience

### Research Scientist / Biostatistician
#### Grant Writing & Study Design
- Contributed to NIH and foundation grant applications by drafting statistical analysis plans, writing sample size and power calculations, and justifying methodological approaches
- Collaborated with investigators to define primary and secondary endpoints, refine study hypotheses, and design efficient study protocols
  
#### Statistical Consultation & Collaboration
- Served as the primary statistical consultant for oncology, cardiology, and population health investigators
- Lead discussions with clinical teams to translate research questions into testable hypotheses and reproducible analysis workflows
- Provided guidance on study design (RCTs, cohort, registry, and real-world data), randomization, and interim analysis planning
  
#### Data Analysis & Modeling
- Performed advanced survival analyses (Cox proportional hazards, competing risks, mixed effect models, generalized additive models, etc) for pediatric oncology and real-world EHR datasets
- Conducted geospatial and neighborhood-level analyses to study cardiovascular health disparities

#### Statistical Programming & Reproducible Research
- Developed validated R and SAS pipelines for data cleaning, analysis, and reporting
- Programed TLFs (tables, listings, figures) for clinical trial deliverables and manuscripts
- Built automated QC processes to ensure reproducibility and regulatory compliance

#### Data Management & Reporting
- Managed and harmonized data from REDCap, NHANES, Flatiron Health, and institutional databases
- Designed and implemented data dictionaries, outlier checks, and variable transformations
- Generated reports and visualizations for Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs), manuscripts, and stakeholder presentations

#### Manuscripts & Dissemination
- Co-authored peer-reviewed manuscripts and abstracts by leading the statistical analysis and results interpretation sections
- Created publication-quality figures, survival curves, and data visualizations for scientific conferences and journals

### Statistical Programming Intern (University of Pennsylvania)
- Provided statistical programming support to NIH-funded trials and observational studies
- Conducted statistical analyses to understand the relationship between social determinants of health and coping strategies among caregivers of heart failure patients
- Developed statistical models using SAS and NHANES data, contributing to an NIH-funded observational study
- Assisted in formulating data analysis plans and contributed to research studies

### Clinical Background (Dentistry)
- Prior to biostatistics, worked as an Endodontist with expertise in root canal therapy and preventive oral health education
- Organized and led dental health camps to promote oral hygiene among school children
